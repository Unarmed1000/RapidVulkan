# RapidVulkan
Experimental low level header only C++11 RAII wrapper classes for the Vulkan API. 
The RAII class design is heavily inspired by std::unique_ptr and should be compatible with STL containers.

One header/source file pair is included for 'debugging' namely DebugStrings which is entirely optional.

The code is auto generated by RAIIGen.

This code is still in early prototyping mode so some of it might not even compile.

Defines:
- RAPIDVULKAN_DISABLE_PARAM_VALIDATION   = Disable input parameter validation
